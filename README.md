# PhotosApp
This repository was forked from a project I worked on with <a href="https://www.github.com/patricknogaj">Patrick Nogaj</a><br>
for 01:198:213 Software Methodology (Rutgers University).

PhotosApp is a desktop application for managing images.

Users can:
- Create photo albums
- Add/remove images to photo albums
- Add tags to images within photo albums
- Search for images using combinations of tags

## Notes
- Written in Java 1.8, on Eclipse
- README/documentation is WIP.
